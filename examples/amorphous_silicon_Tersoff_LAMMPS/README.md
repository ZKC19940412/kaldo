# `amorphous_silicon_Tersoff_LAMMPS`

Example amorphous_silicon_Tersoff_LAMMPS illustrates how to perform thermal 
transport simulation for an amorphous silicon sample (512 atoms system) with
[LAMMPS USER-PHONON ](https://lammps.sandia.gov/doc/Packages_details.html#pkg-user-phonon) package as force calculator.

- The force constants calculation proceeds as follows:
			
	in.aSi512:
    1.  Compute 2nd and 3rd force constants with LAMMPS USER-PHONON
			
	or
			
	get_precalculated_fc.sh:
	1.  Download precalculated force constants computed with LAMMPS USER-PHONON

- 1_aSi512_Tersoff_thermal_conductivity.py proceeds as follows:

    1. Set up force constant object by loading in 2nd, 3rd force constants computed with LAMMPS USER-PHONON.
			
	2. Set up phonon object and perform quantum simulation at 300K.
			
	3. Set up Conductivity object and compute thermal conductivity with Quasi Harmonic Green Kubo method.
			
	4. Set up Conductivity object and compute diffusivity with QHGK method.

- 2_aSi512_Tersoff_visualize_QHGK_properties.py proceeds as follows:

	1. Set up force constant object by loading in 2nd, 3rd force constants computed with LAMMPS USER-PHONON.
			
	2. Set up phonon object and perform quantum simulation at 300K.
			
	3. Set up Conductivity object and compute thermal conductivity and diffusivity with QHGK method.
			
	4. Visualize diffusivity and cumulative conductivity from QHGK method as functions of frequency.

- To compute 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> order force constants with LAMMPS USER-PHONON, navigate to this directory and execute:
```bash
./mpirun -np 8 /path/to/lammps/src/lmp_mpi < in.aSi512 > aSi512.log 
```
- To comput 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> order force constants with speed-up LAMMPS USER-PHONON, navigate to this directory and execute:
```bash
./mpirun -np 8 /path/to/lammps/src/lmp_mpi < in.aSi512_speed_up > aSi512_speed_up.log 
```
- To obtain precalcluated 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> order force constants, navigate to this directory and execute:
```bash
chmod +x  get_precalculated_fc.sh
