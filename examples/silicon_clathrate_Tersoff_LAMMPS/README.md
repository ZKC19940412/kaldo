# `silicon_clathrate_Tersoff_LAMMPS`

Example silicon_clathrate_Tersoff_LAMMPS illustrates how to perform thermal 
transport simulation for a type I clathrate (46 atoms per cell) system using
[LAMMPS USER-PHONON ](https://lammps.sandia.gov/doc/Packages_details.html#pkg-user-phonon) package as force calculator.

- The force constant calculation proceeds as follows:

    in.Si46:
    1.  Compute 2nd, 3rd force constants computed with LAMMPS USER-PHONON
			
	or

	get_precalculated_fc.sh:
	1.  Download precalculated force constants computed with LAMMPS USER-PHONON


- 1_Si46_Tersoff_harmonic_properties.py proceeds as follows:

    1. Set up force constant object by loading in computed 2nd, 3rd force constants computed with LAMMPS USER-PHONON.

    2. Set up phonon object (3x3x3 k-point mesh) and perform quantum simulation at 300K.
     
    3. Compute and visualize harmonic properties (i.e. dispersion relation, group velocity and DOS). 

-  2_Si46_Tersoff_thermal_conductivity.py proceeds as follows:

    1. Set up force constant object by loading in computed 2nd, 3rd force constants computed with LAMMPS USER-PHONON.

    2. Set up phonon object (3x3x3 k-point mesh) and perform quantum simulation at 300K.

    3. Set up Conductivity object and compute thermal conductivity with Relaxation Time Approximation (RTA) method.

-  3_Si46_Tersoff_visualize_anharmonic_properties.py proceeds as follows:

    1. Set up force constant object by loading in computed 2nd, 3rd force constants computed with LAMMPS USER-PHONON.
			
    2. Set up phonon object (3x3x3 k-point mesh) and perform quantum simulation at 300K.

	3. Compute and visualize phase spaces and life times from RTA.
